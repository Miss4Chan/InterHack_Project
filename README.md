# Project Description
This Github project is a computer vision application that consists of two parts: a Python script and a Java-based blockchain application. The Python script utilizes the Haar classifier and image segmentation to track cars moving on a street and recognize their license plates. If a car breaks a traffic law, such as moving too fast or parking improperly, its license plate is stored for future reference. The license plate data is then transferred to the second part of the project, which is a Java-based blockchain application that stores the license plate data securely.

The blockchain technology is used to ensure immutability and prevent the license plate data from being easily tampered with. The Java-based blockchain application is designed using the Spring Boot framework and uses the Hibernate ORM for database connectivity. The application stores the license plate data as transactions on a blockchain network, ensuring that the data is secure and transparent.

# Technologies Used
The Python script utilizes the OpenCV computer vision library, which is written in C++ and provides a wide range of functions for image and video analysis. The Haar classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for object detection, while image segmentation is a technique used to separate an image into meaningful segments.

The Java-based blockchain application is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a simple and efficient way to create production-ready applications. The application uses the Hibernate ORM for database connectivity and the Spring Data JPA library for data access. The blockchain network is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric framework, which provides a flexible and modular architecture for building distributed ledger applications.
